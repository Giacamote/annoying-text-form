This is a simple web app showcasing an annoying way of receiving user text input. 

To run it is recommended to use the Live Server extension in VS Code. Right clicking in the index.html and selecting the "Open with Live Server" option should result in the app loading into a browser.

The idea is simple:
- clicking in the text area will display a dropdown menu containing the letters of the alphabet and the underscore (that should be used as a space character).
- And each letter will display a nested dropdown, also with the letters of the alphabet. So you can write by going down on the dropdown levels. 
- Clicking the text area again will reset what you wrote.
- Clicking the "Enviar" button will display what you wrote in the output box
